# Import Torch

In 2024, we were known as [`dingdongs`](https://github.com/qitianshi/brainhack-24). Participating in the Novice category of TIL-AI 2024, we made it through to the finals, confident that with our model performances, we would secure a placing on the podium. The actual run however proved us all wrong: one specific testcase failed entirely, costing us 100 precious points as we slipped from 2nd place to 4th, and we were not be able to catch up.

The reason why said test case failed? We _literally_ forgot to `import torch`.

This year was different — none of us could commit full-time, none of us were confident in making it past qualifers. We were only here because Tianshi got poached by the organisers (because of the `import torch` story) and we really just went to support our friend.

Qualifers were nothing but smooth — errors everywhere, dead ends with most models that we tried, and we were 40th place in the qualifers on the last day. Hours before the deadline, a few of us sat in our discord call, and decided on a hail mary submission for the Reinforcement Learning component — and we made _the great leap forward_ from 40th to 10th, leapfrogging 30 teams in the process and squeezing into the top 16 to make it to the semi-finals.

We thought our story would end there, but that proved to only be the start of our fairytale run — upseeding higher seeded teams in the semi-finals with better performing algorithms for our guards and scouts, and eventually placing 2nd in the finals.

While we didn't win 1st place, if you considered what we went through last year, the storywriting couldn't have been any better. None of us could have predicted any of this, and as we always joke about it, _"We have reclaimed what was rightfully ours."_

## Everything in between

Here, you will find what we thought were the best representations of us in this year's TIL-AI — the code, Dockerfiles, and everything else in between. Our [writeups](./writeup.md) are accessible in this same repository as well.
