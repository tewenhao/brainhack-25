# Import Torch

Back in 2024, we were known as [`dingdongs`](https://github.com/qitianshi/brainhack-24), competing in the Novice category of TIL-AI. We made it to the finals, confident that our models would carry us to the podium. But reality hit hard — one test case failed completely, costing us 100 precious points and dropping us from 2nd to 4th.  

Why did it fail?  
We _literally_ forgot to `import torch`.

Fast forward to this year: none of us could commit full-time, and none of us expected to even make it past the qualifiers. We were only here because Tianshi got poached by the organisers — ironically, because of the `import torch` story — and we joined to support a friend.

The qualifiers were far from smooth. Errors were everywhere, most of our models hit dead ends, and on the final day, we were sitting at 40th place. In a last-ditch effort, a few of us hopped into a Discord call and made a Hail Mary submission for the Reinforcement Learning component.  

Somehow, that single move launched us from 40th to 10th — leapfrogging 30 teams and squeezing into the top 16 for the semi-finals, in what we called _the Great Leap Forward_.

We thought that would be the end of our story. Instead, it became the start of our fairytale run. We upseeded stronger teams in the semis with better-performing algorithms for our guards and scouts, and ultimately secured **2nd place** in the finals.

We didn’t win 1st — but looking at where we came from, the story couldn't have been written better. As we like to say:  
_“We’ve reclaimed what was rightfully ours.”_

## Everything in Between

In this repository, you’ll find what we believe best represents our journey through this year’s TIL-AI — our code, Dockerfiles, experiments, and everything else in between. Our full [writeups](./writeup.md) are available here as well.
