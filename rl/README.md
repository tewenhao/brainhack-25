# RL

Hello, welcome to hell.
The final submitted model is in hardcode, I am too lazy to show how to use it in RL_manager, just look at propertestrun.py, the parameters may be slightly off, I was dropped on my head as a child so my memory is foggy.
The rest of the code inside this folder is just stuff Im too lazy to send to Semakau.

# Lore
Due to reasons I shall not specify, I had many issues with installation of docker, pip and conda on one of my laptops. That wasted a significant portion of time on trivial matters.
It also meant I had to first try repos that did not use docker, or older versions of python.
My original slightly buggy hardcode was started 9 hours before qualifiers, because of the shortcuts I did, it worsened my approach for my final hardcode. I also only finally gave up on MARL 2 days before finals, so my general approach for hardcode is a shortcut.

The most progress I made with RL was updating [DAVIDADSP](https://github.com/davidADSP/SIMPLE) to 3.12, however that was at 1 week left to the finals, hence the results were unimpressive.
